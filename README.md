Robust, lightweight, configurable `python-poetry` Docker images for any use
case.

_NOTE: This repository is **not** an official project from the creators of
Python Poetry. Hopefully you find it useful anyway!_

## Quickstart

Most of the time, you will be using these images as a base image for your own
Dockerfiles (e.g. devcontainers, building Python applications, etc.)

```Dockerfile
FROM thehale/python-poetry

RUN poetry --version
# Your build steps here.
```

However, you can also download and run the latest `python-poetry` Docker image
by pulling it from DockerHub.

```
docker pull thehale/python-poetry
docker run --rm thehale/python-poetry poetry --version
```

There are tagged images for all the latest stable versions of `python-poetry`
for all versions of Python that Poetry supports (>3.7). You can see the [full
tag list on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/thehale/python-poetry/tags).

## Build Your Own Image

This repo automatically builds images for the latest stable versions of
`python-poetry` for all supported versions of Python (>3.7).

- You can see the full build matrix in
  [.github/workflows/docker-image.yml](https://github.com/thehale/docker-python-poetry/blob/master/.github/workflows/docker-image.yml)

However, if you need a combination that isn't automatically built, you can
easily create your own by modifying the command below to contain your preferred
values for `POETRY_VERSION` and `PYTHON_IMAGE_TAG`:

```bash
make build-version \
    POETRY_VERSION="1.1.13" \
    PYTHON_IMAGE_TAG="3.10-slim"
```

This image will also defined an unprivileged 'nonroot' user with UID:GID 1000:1000 to be used in your derived
images with the USER directive and run your apps more safely. In this case of course remeber to assign the
corresponding ownership to your application tree.
